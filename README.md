# Viper

Viper is e **V** erything **I** s **PER** mitted, a simple blog management system written in PHP.
Post something in markdown style, and you'll set to publish. I create this one for my beloved friends, Subhan Toba. So people now can write what is in their mind via a fun blogging system.

# Philosophy

The main idea is create a simple blog management system, make it simple, always simple as KISS.

# Requirement and Installation

### The requirement
- PHP >= 5.3
- Composer
- MongoDB
- PHP Mongo Client

### Installation
- Clone
- Run `composer install -vvv`
- Install MongoDb
- Install PHP Mongo Client
- Link the `www` to somewhere inside your web server path
- It's like a Joomla, Wordpress, or something like it's the first time you access the web. No config, so fill the author form
- For first time, you may connect to internet to get your gravatar image id (see in FAQ), so it take some times depends on your internet connection
- Ready to set
